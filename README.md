Repository should work both for WSL Ubuntu 20 and for Docker (based on linux Python3.8 image)
Ubuntu 18 might need reddis or uwsgi installation and configuration workarounds.
Main idea is to use Django for ORM, API, admin panel
Next:
- React front end, normalized data on front end (db, state, routing?)
- Admin
- API docs generation
- Tests
- Authentication, including social
- Mail integration (salesforce?)
- Chat
- Resume, Portfolio, Blog with comments option
- Social sharing and permalinks
- Long background processes with socket support: progress bars -- uploads, downloads, rendering
- Infinite slideshow
