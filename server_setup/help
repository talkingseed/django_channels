# --rm tells that container should be erased as soon as it terminates
# (which should not happen if you have "tail -f" in place)

# ENTRYPOINT should have something like "tail -f /dev/null" to prevent Docker from exiting 

docker container ls # will show only running, but in dashboard you will be able to see stopped (mostly)
docker image ls
docker image prune
docker run --name mykind
docker run -it "command line" shell-name # is the method to run command if container exits too soon
docker restart mykind # or whatever name you can see in docker dachboard,  like friendly_poitras
docker exec mykind tail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
